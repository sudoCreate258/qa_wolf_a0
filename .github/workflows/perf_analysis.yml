    steps:
    # 1. Checkout the repository code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Setup Node.js environment
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'

    # 3. Install project dependencies
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci

    # 4. Install Playwright browsers required to run the test
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install 

    # 5. Run the specific performance test file multiple times sequentially (5 runs)
    # The loop ensures we get 5 independent data points for averaging/consistency checks.
    # --workers=1 prevents flaky parallel runs which are unsuitable for performance metrics.
